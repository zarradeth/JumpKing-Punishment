### Steam Workshop (Recommended)
The easiest (and recommended) way to install the mod is to simply subscribe to it on the Steam workshop!

### Manual Installation
If for some reason you would like to manually install the mod instead you can grab the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/zarradeth/JumpKing-Punishment/releases).

Once downloaded extract the files in the release into a folder named 'JKMods' in the Content directory of your Jump King install (you will likely need to make this folder yourself).

The mod should now be available when launching the game.

## Settings
If properly installed when launching Jump King the punishment mod should show up in your list of installed mods.

You can select the mod entry (both in game and in the main menu) to access additional settings/options for the mods.

### Device Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to configure a device for use with the mod before it can do anything!

Selecting the Punishment mod in your mod list should open a submenu that lets you select 'Device Options', this option will open a menu with supported device and should present everything you need to configure your feedback device.

For further details on where to get the information required for these settings see the [Feedback Device Setup](FeedbackDeviceSetup.md) page.

### Punishment Mod Settings
> [!TIP]
> It's _highly_ recommended you spend some time tweaking the mod's settings before playing as what settings are best will change from person to person!

Selecting the Punishment mod in your mod list should open a submenu that lets you select 'Punishment Options', selecting this will present all available options for the Punishment mod directly in the game for configuration.
