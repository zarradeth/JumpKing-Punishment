### Manual Installation
If for some reason you would like to manually install the mod instead you can grab the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/zarradeth/JumpKing-Punishment/releases).

Once downloaded extract the files in the release into a folder named 'JKMods' in the Content directory of your Jump King install (you will likely need to make this folder yourself).

The mod should now be available when launching the game.

## Device Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to configure a device for use with the mod before it can do anything!

With the Punishment mod installed there should be a new options menu named 'Devices', this option should present everything you need to configure your feedback device.

For further details on where to get the information required for these settings see the [Feedback Device Setup](FeedbackDeviceSetup.md) page.

## Punishment Mod Settings
> [!TIP]
> It's _highly_ recommended you spend some time tweaking the mod's settings before playing as what settings are best will change from person to person!

With the Punishment mod installed there will be a new option under the 'InGame' options menu, selecting this will present all available options for the Punishment mod directly in the game for configuration.
